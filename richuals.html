      <h2>Ritual Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Cleansing the Space:</strong> Begin by cleansing your space with sage, palo santo, or incense. As the smoke rises, envision the negative energy dissipating from your environment, creating a clean, sacred space.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Grounding and Centering:</strong> Sit in a comfortable position. Place the bowls of water and salt in front of you. Close your eyes, and take a deep breath. As you inhale, visualize pure white light filling your body, and as you exhale, release any lingering tension or negativity. Say aloud:
          <blockquote>"I release all that does not serve me. I banish fear, doubt, and negative thoughts. I am grounded and centered."</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Light the Black Candle (Banishing Negative Thoughts):</strong> As you light the black candle, focus on releasing any negative thoughts, fears, or self-doubt that hinder your progress. Visualize these thoughts being absorbed by the flame. Say:
          <blockquote>"With this flame, I banish all negativity from my mind and spirit. I release all thoughts that block my path. Peace fills my being."</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Light the White Candle (Clarity and Mental Stability):</strong> After lighting the white candle, visualize a bright light enveloping you, clearing away mental fog and inviting clarity and calm. Say:
          <blockquote>"I call upon peace and clarity of mind. I am calm, patient, and stable in my thoughts and actions. I am a stable and loving parent, guiding my children with wisdom."</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Light the Green Candle (Wealth, Growth, and Opportunities):</strong> Light the green candle and hold the citrine in your hand. Visualize a golden light filling you, symbolizing abundance, wealth, and new opportunities. Say:
          <blockquote>"I attract abundance in all forms. Wealth flows to me effortlessly, and I manage it with wisdom and responsibility. New opportunities in the arts, entertainment, and beyond are drawn to me like a magnet. I welcome a new home filled with love and prosperity."</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Infuse Your Crystals:</strong> Hold the clear quartz and citrine in your hands. Close your eyes and imagine these crystals amplifying your intentions. See them glowing brightly, charged with the energy of your desires: clarity, wealth, opportunity, stability. Say:
          <blockquote>"I charge these stones with my intentions. They carry my will and amplify my desires. I am aligned with success, wealth, and opportunity."</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Write Down Your Intentions:</strong> Take your vision board or notebook and write down your goals in the present tense. Write as if they have already happened. For example:
          <ul>
            <li>"I am free from negative thoughts."</li>
            <li>"I am financially abundant, and wealth flows easily to me."</li>
            <li>"I am a patient and stable parent, nurturing my children with love."</li>
            <li>"I attract exciting opportunities in the entertainment world."</li>
            <li>"I have a beautiful new home, filled with peace and prosperity."</li>
          </ul>
          Visualize each intention as you write, feeling the emotions of already achieving these goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Final Affirmation:</strong> Stand up and say aloud with conviction:
          <blockquote>"I am open to receiving the wealth, opportunities, and peace that the universe offers. I am aligned with abundance, mental clarity, and stability in all areas of my life. My new home, success, and personal growth are manifesting now."</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Close the Ritual:</strong> Blow out the candles in the reverse order: green, white, black. Thank the energies and elements you called upon. Let the smoke or scent from your candles fill the room with the vibration of your new reality.
          <br /><br />
          <em>Optional:</em> Keep the citrine with you or in a place of work to continue attracting wealth and success. Place the clear quartz in your home for clarity and stability.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>After the Ritual</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Meditate or journal for a few minutes to reflect on any insights or feelings that came up.</li>
        <li>Take consistent, small actions in alignment with your intentions (e.g., apply for new opportunities, budget wisely, or practice patience with your children).</li>
        <li>Revisit your vision board or notebook regularly to reinforce your desires.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This ritual combines the power of intention, energy work, and visualization to manifest the changes and opportunities you seek, while grounding you in mental stability and clarity.</p>
